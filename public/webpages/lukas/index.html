        <h2>About the course</h2>
        <p>
            This course aims to give the student knowledge about the Android platform, the tools for developing
            applications (apps) for this platform as well as how take advantage of the capabilities of Android devices,
            such as sensors and cameras.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, we will take a look at designing and implementing user interfaces when working on a platform
            with vast difference between device screens.

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>
            You should form groups of two to three people for the project. The project is open, and you are free to form
            the scope of the project, as long as your project complies with the minimum specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            The minimum requirements, i.e. the requirements to receive the minimum <em>passed</em> grade (02) are the
            following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must create an Android app.</li>
            <li>The app must run on Android 4.0 and above.</li>
            <li>The app must support both <em>phones</em> and <em>tablets</em> of different resolutions.</li>
            <li>
                The app must use a range of advanced technology <em>(minimum 2)</em> in a meaningful way, these
                technologies could be:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sensors.</li>
                    <li>Camera.</li>
                    <li>GPS.</li>
                    <li>Maps.</li>
                    <li>Services.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You will develop the project in groups, and we will have a round of presentations around the end of the
            course, where you will get to show-off what you have made.

            All students will be graded according to the Danish grading scale. The grade given will be based on the
            student’s work during all three weeks as well as the final project and presentation.
